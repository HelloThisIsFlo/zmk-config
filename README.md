# Flo's Magic ZMK Config

## Structure
- **`config`**: Contains almost everything
  - See the `features` directory for a hierarchally organized list of features
- **`Analysis`**: Bigram analysis used to find AKs (Adaptive Keys)

## Alpha Layout: Naquadah
> **The driving question:** What if we built a layout that _required_ adaptive keys?

Naquadah is a heavy variation of HandsDown Titanium, it's so modified as a matter of fact, it's practically unrecognizable.
Its core principles are:
- It should feel like it "flows":
  - Extremely low SFB: **0.082%** (See `sfb.py` in `Analysis/scripts`)
  - Low Redirects (~<2%)
  - IN Rolls >> OUT Rolls
  - The few SFBs left should ideally be on syllable breaks
- Adaptive Keys are **NOT** optional (this layout is useless without AKs)

### Naquadah and its 31 AKs
_Note: This is designed for heavy colstag keyboards (Chocofi)_

```

Naquadah layout:
================
   w  m  p  x              =  .  ;  /
j                                      '
   s  n  t  k              ,  a  e  i
c                                      h
   g  l  d  v              -  u  o  y
f                                      b

                r        space

The position of the special chars is still in flux (only . , ' are fixed)


The 31 accompanying AKs: (Note: This is the beta version, I'll update once the list of AKs is stable)
============
## SFB AKs ###################################
"A, => AU",
"U- => UA",

"E/ => EO",
"O' => OE", # Better than OH because of "Oh! really?"

"GF => GS",

"LG => LL",
"LX => LM",
"LJ => LG", # To remove SFB caused by LG => LM (aLGorithm)

"NP => NL",
"NX => NP", # To remove SFB caused by NP => NL (iNPut)

"MT => MN",
"NW => NM",

"PX => PT",

"SR => SW",
"WJ => WS",

"YH => YI", # More comfortable than YB => YI
"IH => IB", # Definitely better than YB => IB (because of maYBe)
"B; => BI",
##############################################



## IMPOSSIBLE Movements (on Chocofi) #########
"SJ => SF",
##############################################


## Comfort AKs ###############################
"DV => LV",
"DK => LK",
"DF => DV", # To remove SFB caused by DV => LV

"TK => NK",
"KT => KN",
"TV => NV",

"SX => SK",
"PG => PL", # For M->P->L, but also for regular P->L
##############################################


## Repeat AKs ################################
## Only for pinkies & ring fingers (skipped II because it's so rare)
"FG => FF",
"SD => SS",
"B, => BB",
"CG => CC", # CD would technically work, but it would make using the terminal a nightmare
"GC => GG",
"PW => PP", # Not using PM because of 6PM, 7PM, ...
"MW => MM",
"O- => OO",
##############################################

## Concepts
_Many concepts are based on Alan's amazing work: [Hands Down Layouts](https://sites.google.com/alanreiser.com/handsdown/home/hands-down-neu)_


### Adaptive Keys (Alan Reiser)
Key behaving differently if pressed in quick successions. Virtually removes any remaining SFB
- It works with a combination of layers, macros, and behaviors
- It relies on the inner workings of the Macro queue implementation in ZMK
  - Very reliable (no missed keys in more than a year), but
    - It is sort of a hack
    - There are some very minor caveats, [combo hack](config/features/hands_down/adaptive_keys/combos.dtsi), and some issues in very specific cases when using HRMs)
    - Maintaining and debugging issues with this requires understading the inner workings of ZMK
    - Eventually I'd may implement this in ZMK directly, but for now this has worked flawlessly so I'm keeping it as is.
  - That being said, it works, and it works well (tested on burst words at 200wpm+)

<br/>

### Callum Style Mods (Callum)
After using HRMs for about a year, and tweaking everything I could tweak about it I felt it was a bottleneck. I had always looked down on Callum style mods until .... I actually tried it ðŸ˜…. It's been love at first sight.
- One shot mods
- On tap, they chain and stack up
- On hold, they act as regular mods. With a special feature in ZMK to enable the mod being pressed while tap/hold is decided (useful for mouse actions)
- The mods layer (action layer) stay active for a few milliseconds after releasing
  - This is to ensure the correct tap/hold resolution
  - It guarantees we never have to think about the timing.
  - As long as the order is correct, it will work as expected
    - Correct order: 
      - Mod Layer Press -> Mod 1 -> Mod 2 -> Mod Layer Release 
      - Mod Layer Press -> Mod 1 -> Mod 2 press -> Mod Layer Release -> Mod 2 release
      - ...
    - Incorrect order:
      - Mod Layer Press -> Mod 1 -> Mod Layer Release -> Mod 2 press & release
      - ...
        
<br/>

### Other
- **Switch Device**: Switch the device and uses the associated layer
- **Linger Keys (Alan Reiser)**: Does 2 different action on short tap vs hold. Essentially a tap-hold.
- **Magic parenthesis**: One combo does 4 different types of parenthesis
  - Depends on how long it's held and whether or not it's shifted
- And probably more ...
